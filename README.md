## New Features
1. KillAura
    - Prevents the player from hitting while he is eating
2. InvMoveA
    - Prevents the player from running and shifting resources in the inventory *(only if sprinting)*

<!-- 3. Velocity flag remake
-  If the player has velocity enabled, anti-cheat will try to throw him first (like the player doesn't use any akb), and then it will start to setback -->

## Planned to add
- [x] ~~Hit and eat checks~~
- [x] ~~Add Invmove checks~~
- [ ] Velocity
- [ ] Fix velocity upper version 1.16.5
